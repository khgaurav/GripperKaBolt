Out team plans to have three phases in this project, by fitting the weather data from the past years in a mathematical model we will inititate the first phase which will be setting up our model in local areas for testing and further development, this will allow us to make changes to our model and make the models functionality even vast by adding features such as, direct information protocols, which will inform the concerned authorities about the condition of the place for the better readiness of first responders, in phase two we plan to make the model capable of telling exactly the steps to be taken by not only the first responders but the people most likely to be affected by the disasters in that area, Who would not love an app which literally tells you to carry an umbrella every time its going to rain??, in the final phase the app would need specific permissions in oneâ€™s device such as accesing the travel details of the individual, helping everyone not only in and around the area but also people travelling to the location in the time frame of the disaster

We are planning to use Machine learning for predictive analytics by tracking patterns and analyzing information to know about the possibilities of the same occurring in future. Predictive analytics can assist us by providing us details on the specific areas where we are less affected. This information helps with respect to sending rescue teams to particular regions  and support sauthorities by empowering them with information on areas minimally affected by the calamity.
